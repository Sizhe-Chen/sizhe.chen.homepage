I'm a second-year postgraduate student at School of Global Health, Chinese Center for Tropical Diseases Research, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China. I received my Bachelor of Medicine degree in the School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University. My research interests are Next Generation Sequencing, Public Health, Bioinformatics and Machine Learning. See my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xy1ZOE_R70Ij-LB78fU0swIOhcjfUKYI/view?usp=sharing). I'm currently applying for Ph.D. positions.
